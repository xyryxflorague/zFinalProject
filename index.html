                    <div class="line"></div>
                    <p>The idea of putting up an institution propped during one casual conversation among close friends talking about daring challenges. At first, the concept was considered a “foolish joke”, considering the financial status of each one. However, it was taken seriously after each member reflected that, with their educational background and working experiences, each could play a major role in the management of one educational institution. Indeed, with mere guts and modest capital, the group has complied with the requirements of the Security and Exchange Commission-Baguio Branch to register the Cordillera Career Development College (CCDC) as a corporation on April 6, 1993 and incidentally making it the “first private educational institution of higher learning in the BIMAK provinces!” <br><br></p><br>
                    <h2>About the School Logo</h2>
                    <p>The TERRACES remind us of the character of the Igorots behind the Natural Wonder. It emphasizes that industry, courage and hope are key elements to attain our goals.<br><br>

                        The SOLIBAO reminds the Institution to be forever faithful to its calling of leading the way for the Filipino Youth, particularly the Cordilleran, to a promising future by providing quality and competitive education they so much deserve.<br><br>
                        
                        The beautiful and indigenous music from the GONGS describe the harmonious atmosphere within the academic community.<br><br>
                        
                        The various academic fields of the College are represented by the LAMP, WHEELS, BOOKS and TORCH, while the ENTWINED BLANKETS reiterate the unity of all the Cordilleran tribes, these prove further that there is unity in diversity.<br><br>
                        
                        MAN and WOMAN represent THE CHILD who is the center of the educational process.<br><br>
                        
                        HOLISTIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE PERSON represents the central theme of the entire vision and mission of the institution.<br><br>
                        
                        The JAR illustrates that these precious treasures are under the care of the fortified earthen vessel.</p><br><br><br>
